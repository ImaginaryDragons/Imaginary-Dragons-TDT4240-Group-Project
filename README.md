Best game ever to be made

## About the game
This game is inspired by Playing With Fire - a bomberman style game multi-player game. The aim of the game is to plant dynamite that explode in order to kill the enemy or enemies. The players, here represented as dragon characters, start off in each corner of the map, blocked from each other with different obstacles. In order to make your way to the enemy, the player has to destroy blocks by dropping fireballs. The fire will destroy the obstacles and eventually paths to the other players are made. The aim then is to tactically plant fires in order to blow up the other players without dying yourself. Power-ups are hidden under different block that will give the player special abilities when picked up. Examples of such abilities include speed upgrade and a wider range for your fire. Each player has three lives. A life is lost when the player is hit by fire. The goal of the game is to be last man standing. There is a 3-minute time limit and the winner of the game will get a score, which is the time spent on killing the enemy. The less time you use, the higher you will get on the high score list.
